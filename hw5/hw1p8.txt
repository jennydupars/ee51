Homework 1 Problem 8

After setting a breakpoint at the IllegalEventHandler, we stop there. Then I stepped 
through and returned after IllegalEventHandler finished, to address 0040:0046. 

That means that pcdebug really didn't like doing the line of code at address 0040:0044. 
The line of code that it messed up on is DIV CX. 

This was after CWD, which converted AX to DX:AX, a doubleword. The bug in the code 
is that we didn't clear DX before dividing by CX!
