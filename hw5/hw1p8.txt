		After setting a breakpoint at the IllegalEventHandler, we stop there. 
		Then I stepped through and returned after IllegalEventHandler finished,
		to address 0040:0046. 

		That means that pcdebug really didn't like doing the line of code 
		at address 0040:0044:
			0040:0044 		DIV 	CX 

		This was after CWD, which converted AX to DX:AX, a doubleword. This 
		instruction concatenates DX (ffffH) with AX (fff9). This is fine, but 
		the bug in the code is that we didn't clear DX before dividing AX by CX.
