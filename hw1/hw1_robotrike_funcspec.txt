ROBOTRIKE FUNCTIONAL SPECIFICATION

DESCRIPTION: 				The RoboTrike is a three-wheeled robotic car that can be controlled using a keypad and display. It will be able to move in the four directions through translational motion, and will be able to fire a laser depending on user commands.


OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION: 	This system allows an operator to control a three-wheeled robotic car via a keypad and display over a possibly wireless serial interface. The system consists of two separate components, a keypad and display through which the user interacts with the system and the three-wheeled motor unit that can move around under user control. This unit can also send back status to be displayed. The two units communicate over a serial interface using a defined protocol. Since the serial data may be arriving much faster than it can be acted upon by the RoboTrike or displayed it will be necessary to buffer the serial port data.
