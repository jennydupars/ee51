Homework 2


Problem 5: Target Board Familiarization

Keypad: 

When I was looking at memory location 080H: 
first row: 7f7e, 7f7d, 7f7b, 7f77. Can create 7f70 through 7f7e, with the 
first button as 1, 2nd as 2, 3rd as 4, 4th as 8 for last digits. (so if you don't 
press the first one but press all the rest, then you will get 7f71). This sets 
the last digit of the value that we see in the debugger. 

second row: 7e7f, 7d7f, 7b7f, 777f, can create 707f through 7e7f, with the 
first button as 1, 2:2, 3: 4, 4:8. This sets the second-to-last digit.

Looking at 081H, 082H, 083H will give you the same thing, but the rows shift 
downward one every time. 


Display: 

Changing values of 00H gives you changes in the first digit. Setting the value 
equal to 1, 2, 4, 8, and subsequent values of 2, up to 128, will highlight the 
outline of the 0 (when value is 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32). A value of 64 will 
highlight horizontal line in the middle. A value of 128 will light up the dot. 
255 is the maximum value, and that lights up everything. Any value in between 
will light up whichever branches whose corresponding numbers add up to that
value. Setting the value to 0 will turn it off. 

To change which digit in the display to change, use 00H for first digit, 01H 
for second digit, and so on, until 07H, the last digit. 


Problem 6: 

NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt):
    Address of first instruction: f800:753c
    The first three instructions: PUSH  BP
                                  MOV   BP,SP
                                  PUSH  AX
                                  
A breakpoint (INT 3 input):
    Address of first instruction: 2000:0004
    The first three instructions: CALL  e8ef
                                  CALL  e8f2
                                  CALL  e8f5
                                  
A single-step interrupt: 
    Address of first instruction: f800:75fe
    The first three instructions: NOP
                                  NOP
                                  JMP   SHORT 7510
