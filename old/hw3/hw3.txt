; QueueInit
;
; Description: 		Initialize the queue of the passed length and element size
;				   	at the passed address. This procedure does all the 
;					necessary initialization to prepare the queue for use. 
;					After calling this procedure the queue should be empty 
;					and ready to accept values. The passed length is the 
;					maximum number of items that can be stored in the queue. 
;					The passed element size specifies whether each entry in 
;					the queue is a byte (8-bits) or a word (16-bits). If it is 
;					true (non-zero) the elements are words and if it is false 
;					(zero) they are bytes. The address is passed in	SI by value 
;					(thus the queue starts at DS:SI), the length (passed by 
;					value in AX, and the element size (passed by value in BL). 
;
;
; Operation: 		Set the STRUC's values according to the values passed into 
;					the function. 
;
; Arguments: 		SI - address passed in by the function
;					AX - length of queue
;					BL - size of element (bytes or words)
; Return Value:		None. 
;
; Local Variables:	Shared. 
; Shared Variables: The STRUC: We'll call it struc. 
; 					length - will be set to l, the maximum number of elements
;					size - the size of elements to be put in 
;						  (size = 1 means word, size = 0 means byte)
;					headPTR - holds the address of the first element 
; 					tailPTR - holds the address of the spot after the last element
;
; Global Variables: None. 
;
; Input: 			None. 
; Output: 			None. 
;
; Error Handling: 	None. 
;
; Algorithms: 		None. 
; Data Structures: 	STRUC: has properties length, size, address, head pointer,
;					and tail pointer
;
;

;Pseudocode:

;	struc.length = l 
;	struc.size = s 
;	struc.headPTR = 0
;	struc.tailPTR = 0 




; QueueEmpty
;
; Description: 		The function is called with the address (a) of the queue to
;					be checked and returns with the zero flag set if the queue 
;					is empty and with the zero flag reset otherwise. The address 
;					(a) is passed in (SI) by value (thus the queue starts at 
;					(DS:SI).
;
; Operation: 		Compare the addresses of the tail pointer and head pointer. 
;					If their difference is 0, then that means the the queue is 
;					empty. 
;			
; Arguments: 		SI - address of queue to be checked
; Return Value: 	ZF - set to 1 if queue is empty, 0 if not.
;
; Local Variables: 	Shared. 
; Shared Variables:	The STRUC: We'll call it struc. 
; 					length - will be set to l, the maximum number of elements
;					size - the size of elements to be put in 
;						  (size = 1 means word, size = 0 means byte)
;					headPTR - holds the address of the first element 
; 					tailPTR - holds the address of the spot after the last element 
; 					
; Global Variables:	None. 
;
; Input: 			None. 
; Output: 			None.
;
; Error Handling: 	None.
;
; Algorithms: 		Compare the tail and head pointer. If they're the same, 
;					there are no elements and the ZF will be set. 
; Data Structures: 	STRUC: has properties length, size, address, head pointer,
;					and tail pointer
;
;

Pseudocode:

	CMP struc.headPTR, struc.tailPTR 
	

;
;
;
; QueueFull
;
; Description: 		The function is called with the address of the queue to be
;					checked and returns with the zero flag set if the queue is 
;					full and with the zero flag reset otherwise. The address is
;					passed in by value (thus the queue starts at DS:SI).
;
; Operation:		We will add 1 to the tail pointer, mod it by the length, and 
;					see if it is equal to the head pointer. This takes care of 
;					queue wraparound.
;
; Arguments:		SI - address of the queue to be checked
; Return Value:		ZF - set if queue is full, clear otherwize. 
;
; Local Variables:	Shared. 
; Shared Variables:	The STRUC: We'll call it struc. 
; 					length - will be set to l, the maximum number of elements
;					size - the size of elements to be put in 
;						  (size = 1 means word, size = 0 means byte)
;					headPTR - holds the address of the first element 
; 					tailPTR - holds the address of the spot after the last element 
; 					
; Global Variables: None. 
;
; Input:			None. 
; Output:			None. 
;
; Error Handling:	None. 
;
; Algorithms:		Add 1 to the tail pointer, and mod it by length of queue. 
;					If the tail pointer is then equal to the head, then the 
;					queue is full. 
; Data Structures: 	STRUC: has properties length, size, address, head pointer,
;					and tail pointer
; 
;
; Pseudocode: 
	
;	// we want struc.tailPTR + 1 to be 0 mod length, so that even when it wraps 
;	// around it will be at the same spot.
;
;	If (struc.tailPTR + 1 % struc.length == struc.headPTR):
;		set zero flag (CMP (struc.tailPTR + 1 % struc.length), struc.headPTR)
;
;
;
;
;
; Dequeue
;
; Description: 		This function removes either an 8-bit value or a 
;					16-bit value (depending on the queue's element size) 
;					from the head of the queue at the passed address (a) 
;					and returns it in AL or AX. The value is returned in 
;					AL if the element size is bytes and in AX if it is words. 
;					If the queue is empty it waits until the queue has a 
;					value to be removed and returned. It does not return 
;					until a value is taken from the queue. The address (a)
;					is passed in SI by value (thus the queue starts at DS:SI).
;
; Operation:		Return the value, and then move the head pointer up.
;
; Arguments:		SI - address of the queue to be checked
; Return Value:		AL or AX - the first thing in line
;
; Local Variables:	Shared. 
; Shared Variables:	The STRUC: We'll call it struc. 
; 					length - will be set to l, the maximum number of elements
;					size - the size of elements to be put in 
;						  (size = 1 means word, size = 0 means byte)
;					headPTR - holds the address of the first element 
; 					tailPTR - holds the address of the spot after the last element 
; 					
; Global Variables:	None. 
;
; Input:			None.
; Output:			None.
;
; Error Handling:	None. 
;
; Algorithms:		We will return the value at the head of the queue, and move
;					the head pointer up a spot. 
; Data Structures: 	STRUC: has properties length, size, address, head pointer,
;					and tail pointer
;
;
; Pseudocode:
; 	while (QueueEmpty):
;		// loops forever until you stop it 
;	endwhile
;
; 	// take the element pointed to by the tail pointer, 
;	// and MOV it to AX or AL depending on the element size.
;	
;	CMP struc.size to 0 and 1: 
;		if 1: they're words
;			Move element[headPTR] -> AX
;			// set headPTR equal to headPTR+2 % length just in case it wraps around
;			headPTR += 2 // to new head of queue 
;			headPTR = headPTR % struc.length // for wraparound
;		if 0: they're bytes
;			Move element[headPTR] -> AL 
;			headPTR += 1 // to new head of queue 
;			headPTR = headPTR % struc.length  //for wraparound 
;	
;
;
;
;
;
; Enqueue
;
; Description: 		This function adds the passed 8-bit or 16-bit(depending 
;					on the element size) value (v) to the tail of the queue 
;					at the passed address (a). If the queue is full it waits 
;					until the queue has an open space in which to add the 
;					value. It does not return until the value is added to the 
;					queue. (This is called a "blocking function".) The address 
;					(a) is passed in SI by value (thus the queue starts at 
;					DS:SI) and the value to enqueue (v) is passed by value 
;					in AL if the element size for the queue is bytes and in 
;					AX if it is words.
;
; Operation:		Move new element to the spot pointed to by the tail pointer
;					and then increment the tail pointer by the appropriate amount.
;
; Arguments:		AL or AX - value to be added
;					SI - address of queue 	
; Return Value:		None. 
;
; Local Variables:	Shared.
; Shared Variables:	The STRUC: We'll call it struc. 
; 					length - will be set to l, the maximum number of elements
;					size - the size of elements to be put in 
;						  (size = 1 means word, size = 0 means byte)
;					headPTR - holds the address of the first element 
; 					tailPTR - holds the address of the spot after the last element
;
; Global Variables: None. 
;
; Input:			None. 
; Output:			None. 
;
; Error Handling:	None. 
;	
; Algorithms:		If the queue is full, we will loop forever until the queue 
;					is not full. Otherwise, we will add the value to the tail
;					of the queue and increment the tail pointer. 
; Data Structures: 	STRUC: has properties length, size, address, head pointer,
;					and tail pointer
;
;
;
; Pseudocode:
	
	while(QueueFull):
		// this is an infinite loop until stopped at some point.
	endwhile 
	
	// else, if there's space:
	Move value -> element[tailPTR]
	
	// appropriately increment tail pointer 
	CMP SIZE to 0 and 1: 
		if 1: value was a word:	
			tailPTR += 2 
			tailPTR = tailPTR % struc.length		// for wraparound 
		if 0: value was a byte: 
			tailPTR += 1 
			tailPTR = tailPTR % struc.length		// for wraparound
